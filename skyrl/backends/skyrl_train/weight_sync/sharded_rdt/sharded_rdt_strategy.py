"""``sharded_rdt`` as a :class:`WeightTransferStrategy`.

A thin adapter over the vendored vLLM trainer-send stack — a ``WeightSource`` feeding
a ``ShardedRDTTrainerWeightTransferEngine`` that the inference workers pull from,
driven by :class:`RdtWeightSyncSender` (``rdt_send.py``). Presenting it through the
shared interface keeps the workers to one sender attribute and one send call.

Two places RDT does not fit the push backends' shape, declared as capabilities so the
workers hold no backend conditional:

* ``trainer_init`` opens the inference side itself, through the blocking
  ``SyncRdtControlPlaneClient``, since the bake needs the source metadata and must run
  under ``set_current_vllm_config``. ``sender_initializes_receivers`` is True, and
  worker rank 0 must not also call ``init_weight_update_communicator``.
* The consumers pull, so there is no chunk stream: this sender overrides
  :meth:`WeightTransferSender.send` and never materializes chunks or metadata.
  ``get_weight_metadata`` on the Megatron extractor is a whole-model
  ``export_hf_weights`` pass, the gather the RDT weight source avoids.

REMOVAL: when SkyRL's pinned vLLM ships trainer-send for NCCL/IPC too, those backends
collapse into this shape and the ``WeightTransferStrategy`` layer goes away. This
adapter is what disappears then; ``rdt_send.py`` stays.

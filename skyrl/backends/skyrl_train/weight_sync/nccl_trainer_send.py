"""Trainer-side NCCL send, vendored from vLLM 0.26.0.

REMOVAL: ``NCCLWeightTransferEngine.trainer_send_weights`` and the engine's
``trainer_init`` staticmethod were deleted in vLLM 0.28.0, which replaced them
with a trainer-side engine abstraction (``NCCLTrainerWeightTransferEngine``,
dispatched through ``WeightTransferTrainerFactory``). SkyRL still drives the send
itself -- the sender owns the ``/collective_rpc`` round trip in
``broadcast_strategy.py`` -- so this module keeps 0.26.0's behaviour available
under the new pin. Delete it when SkyRL's sender layer moves onto vLLM's
trainer-send engines; that migration also retires ``WeightTransferStrategy``,
``WeightTransferSender`` and ``NewInferenceWorkerWrap``.

``packed_nccl_broadcast_producer`` (the real work) and ``nccl_common.trainer_init``
(the rendezvous) both survive in 0.28.0 unchanged, so this is a thin re-wrap
rather than a copy of the transfer itself.

    Vendored from ``NCCLWeightTransferEngine.trainer_send_weights`` (vLLM 0.26.0),
    with the ``trainer_args`` dict/dataclass flattened into keyword arguments --
    the dataclass (``NCCLTrainerSendWeightsArgs``) was deleted alongside the method.

    ``packed`` must match what the receiving worker was told at init. As of
    vLLM 0.28.0 the worker reads it from ``NCCLWeightTransferInitInfo.packed``
    (set once during ``/init_weight_transfer_engine``) rather than from the
    per-round update info, so the two sides can no longer disagree per round --
    see ``BroadcastInitInfo.to_api_payload``.

        iterator: ``(name, tensor)`` pairs to send.
        group: the ``PyNcclCommunicator`` from ``nccl_trainer_init``.

        packed: batch tensors into packed buffers instead of one broadcast each.
        post_iter_func: maps each pair to the tensor to send. Defaults to taking
            the tensor.
        stream: CUDA stream for the unpacked path. Defaults to the current
            stream. Ignored when ``packed`` (the producer makes its own).
        packed_buffer_size_bytes: packed buffer size. Defaults to vLLM's
            ``DEFAULT_PACKED_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES``, which is also what the worker's
            init info defaults to -- leave unset so the two cannot drift.

"""C-full: isolate the MTP / draft head into its OWN grad buffer + ``DistributedOptimizer``.

Why this exists
---------------
The decoupled draft loss is autograd-clean (it only reaches ``.mtp.*`` params; the trunk hidden and
the shared output/embedding weights are detached). But when the MTP head shares the policy's single
Megatron DDP grad buffer, the head's mere *presence* changes the layout of that buffer and therefore
the floating-point result of the POLICY gradient's distributed reduction (the DP reduce-scatter and the
TP all-reduce of sequence-parallel / layernorm grads, both of which coalesce every ``requires_grad``
param into one flat tensor). That perturbation is deterministic and systematic, and the RL feedback
loop amplifies it into the policy-entropy collapse observed on MiMo-7B with MTP enabled.

Neither separating the grad *clip* (the head's grad does not dilute the policy via the clip — verified)
nor pinning the NCCL algorithm fixes it, because the channel is the shared *buffer/reduction* itself.
The robust fix is to make the policy's grad buffer + reduction byte-identical to a model built with NO
MTP head, while still co-training the head at full strength.

Mechanism
---------
Megatron exposes no "exclude these params from the buffer" API; the only lever is ``requires_grad`` at
DDP-construction time (DDP buckets only ``requires_grad`` params, and changing it *after* the wrap
deadlocks distributed-optimizer init). So:

1. :func:`freeze_mtp_params_pre_wrap` (a provider pre-wrap hook) sets the ``.mtp`` params
   ``requires_grad=False`` *before* the policy is DDP-wrapped, so they are excluded from the policy
   grad buffer -> the policy buffer is byte-identical to the no-MTP build.
2. After the policy optimizer is built, :class:`SeparateMTPOptimizer` flips the head back to
   ``requires_grad=True`` and wraps the SAME ``host.mtp`` submodule (left in place inside ``GPTModel``,
   so capture / replay / weight-export are unchanged) in its own Megatron DDP + ``DistributedOptimizer``.
3. The policy's own ``finalize_model_grads`` would still coalesce the head's layernorm grads into the
   policy TP all-reduce (it iterates every ``requires_grad`` param of the GPTModel). :func:`make_policy_finalize_excluding_mtp`
   wraps it to transiently hide the head during the policy finalize (backward is already complete, so
   this is only a read-time filter), keeping the policy reduction byte-identical to the no-MTP build.
4. The combined ``policy + weight * draft`` backward auto-routes each param's grad to its own buffer
   (the draft loss is autograd-decoupled). We finalize + step the head's optimizer alongside the policy's.

Acceptance test: with C-full on, the fixed-batch no-clip policy-param trajectory must match the no-MTP
run within the run-to-run nondeterminism floor (see
``tests/.../megatron/test_mtp_grad_coupling.py::test_mtp_fixed_batch_param_drift``).

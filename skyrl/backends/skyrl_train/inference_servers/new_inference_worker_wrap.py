"""
vLLM Worker Extension for native weight sync with chunked transfer support.

This module provides NewInferenceWorkerWrap, a vLLM worker extension that
enables chunked weight updates from training to inference using the
start/update/finish lifecycle:

    skyrl_start_weight_update   ->  one or more update_weights_ipc  ->  skyrl_finish_weight_update

This separates the layerwise reload initialization/finalization from individual
chunk transfers, allowing weights to be sent in bounded-memory chunks rather
than all at once.

TODO: Once https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/39212 lands, vLLM will
natively support start_weight_update / update_weights / finish_weight_update
on GPUWorker with dedicated HTTP endpoints. At that point this worker extension
can be removed and SkyRL can call the native endpoints directly instead of
routing through /collective_rpc.

Usage:
    Pass as --worker-extension-cls to vLLM:

    vllm serve ... --worker-extension-cls \
